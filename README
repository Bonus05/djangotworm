django-twisted
This is a library that contains a custom queryset and a custom manager that adds introspection to use
the twisted database api instead of django.  It returns deferred instead of just hitting the database.

To install:

1. Run python setup.py

2. Import and set the manager as the manager for any model

This will keep the orm from blocking.  If you select a related object it will still use the django orm,
not twisted.  This functionality will hopefully be added soon.
